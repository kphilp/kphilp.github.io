	  <h3>Welcome to my blog - where opinions and views expressed are my own</h3>
	  <p> Hello, my name is Kevin Philp. I work as a System Administrator for an international computer sciences company and specialise in windows Tech. Specifically Windows Server 2003, 2008 & 2012. As part of my IDP I recently started doing L&L's with a highly respected and experienced engineer called Chris Neale. One of my topics was to create my own website but had no idea what fill it with. Chris has created a blog and so I decided to do the same. Feel free to check his blog out *be warned* its a tad more technical than mine <a href="http://www.chrisneale.org/">Click here to visit his blog!</a></p>
