	  <h3>Welcome to my blog - where opinions and views expressed are my own</h3>
	  <p> Hello, my name is Kevin Philp. I work as a System Administrator for an international computer sciences company and specialise in windows Tech. Specifically Windows Server 2003, 2008 & 2012. As part of my IDP I recently started doing L&L's with a highly respected and experienced engineer called Chris Neale. One of my topics was to create my own website but had no idea what fill it with. As Chirs has his own blog it inspried me to do my one. Feel free to check his blog out *be warned* its a tad more technial than mine <a href="http://www.chrisneale.org/">Click here to visit his blog!</a></p>
